# 2022-PH-Elections
9 May 2022 - Philippine National Elections webscraper using Selenium (Python)

You can access the COMELEC Transparency server [here](https://2022electionresults.comelec.gov.ph/#/er/0/).

#### Modules used:
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup4
- pandas
- csv
- os
- time

#### Instructions:
1. Just run the 'elections_extract.py' on your terminal
2. The data would automatically be populated on a csv file named 'elections.csv'

ETL process is quite inefficient for now, will upload the data when finished!
